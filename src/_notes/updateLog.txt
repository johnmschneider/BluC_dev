0) update log since last github push

1) Fixed support for character literals. Support was added for lexing strings 
    and chars, and for parsing strings, but the parser didn't check for a 
    character literal.

2) Started work on testing infrastructure (mostly Builder patterns to help
    artificially construct parts of an AST).
